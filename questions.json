        "Its output depends only on its current inputs.",
        "Its output depends on current inputs and past states.",
        "It contains memory elements like flip-flops.",

        "To store frequently accessed data blocks for the CPU.",
        "To speed up the translation of virtual addresses to physical addresses.",

      "question": "In synchronous digital circuit design, a 'hold time violation' in a flip-flop primarily occurs when:",
      "options": [
        "The data signal arrives at the flip-flop input too early before the active clock edge.",
        "The data signal does not remain stable for the minimum required duration *after* the active clock edge.",
        "The clock signal's period is shorter than the sum of propagation delays and setup/hold times.",
        "The reset signal is asserted simultaneously with the clock edge, causing race conditions.",
        "The data signal takes too long to propagate from the previous stage, violating setup time."

      "question": "In the context of digital IC design using Hardware Description Languages (HDLs), what is the primary purpose of 'linting' an RTL design?",

        "To synthesize the RTL code into a gate-level netlist.",
        "To identify common design errors, coding style violations, and potential synthesis issues without simulation.",
