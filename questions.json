      "question": "What is the primary purpose of the Program Counter (PC) in a CPU?",
      "options": [
        "To temporarily store the result of an arithmetic operation.",
        "To hold the instruction currently being executed.",
        "To store the memory address of the next instruction to be fetched.",
        "To manage data transfers between the CPU and main memory.",
        "To control the flow of data within the CPU's internal bus system."

      "question": "In digital IC design, what is the primary advantage of using a Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) over a Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) for on-chip caches?",
      "options": [
        "SRAM offers significantly higher storage density.",
        "SRAM consumes less power per bit stored.",
        "SRAM is non-volatile, retaining data without power.",
        "SRAM provides much faster access times.",
        "SRAM has a simpler manufacturing process."

      "question": "What is a 'control hazard' in a pipelined processor?",
      "options": [
        "It occurs when an instruction needs data that a previous instruction in the pipeline has not yet produced.",
        "It refers to a situation where multiple instructions require the same hardware resource at the same time.",
        "It arises when the processor cannot determine the address of the next instruction to fetch due to a conditional branch or jump instruction.",
        "It describes a scenario where an instruction takes an unexpectedly long time to execute.",
        "It is a consequence of excessive cache misses leading to pipeline stalls."

      "question": "In the physical design flow of an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), what is the primary goal of the 'Routing' step?",
      "options": [
        "To determine the optimal placement of standard cells on the silicon die.",
        "To connect the pins of placed cells and macro-blocks using metal interconnect lines according to the netlist.",
        "To create a balanced clock distribution network to all sequential elements.",
        "To define the overall chip area and the relative positions of major functional blocks.",
        "To verify that the final physical layout accurately reflects the logical schematic."
