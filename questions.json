      "question": "What is the primary advantage of CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) logic over older technologies like TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) in modern digital integrated circuits?",
      "options": [
        "Significantly lower static power consumption",
        "Higher operating frequency at the same voltage",
        "Greater noise immunity against external interference",
        "Simpler and cheaper manufacturing process",

      "question": "In the context of shared-memory multiprocessor systems, what property does the \"Sequential Consistency\" memory model primarily guarantee to the programmer?",
      "options": [
        "All writes by a processor are immediately visible to all other processors.",
        "The result of any execution is the same as if the operations of all processors were executed in some sequential order, and the operations of each individual processor appear in this sequence in the order specified by its program.",
        "Data cached by one processor is automatically updated in all other processors' caches when modified.",
        "Memory operations are always performed in the fastest possible order, often out-of-order, without regard to program order.",
        "Cache misses are eliminated entirely through perfect prefetching mechanisms."

      "question": "In synchronous digital circuit design, \"setup time\" for a flip-flop refers to the minimum amount of time that:",
      "options": [
        "The output of the flip-flop takes to become stable after the active clock edge.",
        "The clock signal must remain stable before the data input can change.",
        "The input data must be stable and valid *before* the active clock edge arrives.",

        "To perform formal verification of the RTL design against its specifications.",
        "To optimize the physical placement and routing of standard cells on the die.",
        "To enable in-circuit testing and debugging of the chip's internal logic and its interconnections on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB).",

      "question": "What is the fundamental reason for implementing a multi-level cache hierarchy (e.g., L1, L2, L3) in a modern CPU?",
      "options": [
        "To expand the total physical addressable memory space for the processor.",
        "To reduce the power consumption of the main memory (DRAM) by keeping it active less frequently.",
        "To provide faster access to frequently used data and instructions by exploiting principles of locality.",
        "To simplify the instruction decoding and execution pipeline within the CPU.",
