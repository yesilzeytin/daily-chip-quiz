      "question": "In a write-back cache memory policy, under what primary condition is a modified (dirty) cache block typically written back to the main memory?",
      "options": [
        "Immediately upon every write operation to the cache.",
        "Only when the corresponding cache block is evicted from the cache to make room for new data.",
        "When the CPU explicitly issues a flush command for that specific block.",
        "At fixed time intervals, regardless of cache activity.",

      "options": [
        "VLIW processors use dynamic scheduling at runtime, while superscalar processors rely on static scheduling by the compiler.",
        "VLIW processors require the compiler to pack multiple independent operations into a single wide instruction, whereas superscalar processors use hardware to dynamically detect and execute independent instructions in parallel.",
        "VLIW processors are always in-order, while superscalar processors are always out-of-order.",
        "Superscalar processors have a simpler control unit than VLIW processors due to less hardware for dependency checking.",
