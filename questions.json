      "question": "What is the primary benefit of increasing the 'associativity' of a CPU cache (e.g., moving from a direct-mapped to a 2-way set-associative cache, or higher)?",
      "options": [
        "It significantly reduces the memory access latency for cache hits by optimizing the lookup speed.",
        "It decreases the overall power consumption of the cache memory by simplifying tag comparisons.",
        "It increases the hit rate by reducing the number of conflict misses, allowing more flexible block placement.",
        "It simplifies the cache controller logic and reduces its complexity, leading to faster design cycles.",

      "options": [
        "GPUs primarily use a deep, in-order pipeline optimized for single-thread performance.",
        "GPUs are designed with a few powerful, complex cores optimized for sequential task execution.",
        "GPUs emphasize massive parallelism with thousands of simpler, energy-efficient cores, ideal for highly parallelizable tasks.",
        "GPUs operate exclusively with fixed-point arithmetic, lacking floating-point capabilities.",
        "GPUs rely heavily on large, multi-level cache hierarchies to handle irregular memory access patterns."
