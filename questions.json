      "question": "What is a primary advantage of CMOS technology in terms of power consumption during static operation (i.e., when not switching)?",
      "options": [
        "It consumes significantly less static power due to negligible leakage current in ideal conditions.",
        "It enables extremely high switching speeds regardless of load capacitance.",
        "It allows for dynamic voltage and frequency scaling to reduce peak power.",
        "It requires a constant high current to maintain logic states, ensuring stability.",
        "It generates very little heat, eliminating the need for cooling solutions."

      "question": "What is the primary characteristic distinguishing Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) from Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM)?",
      "options": [
        "SRAM is volatile, while DRAM is non-volatile.",
        "DRAM is typically faster to access than SRAM.",
        "SRAM requires periodic refreshing of its stored charge, while DRAM does not.",
        "DRAM stores data using a capacitor and a transistor, requiring periodic refresh.",

      "question": "In modern processor architectures, what is the primary mechanism by which Simultaneous Multi-threading (SMT), often referred to as Hyper-threading by Intel, aims to improve CPU utilization?",
      "options": [
        "By dynamically increasing the clock frequency based on the workload demands.",
        "By allowing multiple independent instructions from a single thread to execute concurrently.",
        "By replicating entire processor cores on a single die to execute different threads in parallel.",
        "By rapidly switching between different processes using a hardware-managed context switch mechanism.",
        "By allowing multiple threads to share the same execution units concurrently, hiding latency caused by cache misses or data dependencies."
