      "question": "In a set-associative cache memory organization, how is a main memory block typically mapped to a cache location?",
      "options": [
        "It can be placed in any available line in the entire cache.",
        "It maps to a unique, fixed line within the cache, determined by its address.",
        "It can be placed in any line within a specific set, determined by an index derived from its address.",

      "options": [
        "To ensure all processing units operate synchronously with a single global clock for maximum performance.",
        "To eliminate all clock signals from the design for ultra-low power consumption.",
        "To manage clock domain crossing issues and reduce global clock distribution challenges by allowing independently clocked local modules to communicate asynchronously.",

        "To reduce the overall manufacturing cost by eliminating all physical wires.",
        "To simplify memory access protocols by enforcing a single, global memory space.",
        "To ensure all data transfers are entirely synchronous with a single global clock.",
        "To decrease the complexity of individual IP blocks by shifting all communication logic to a central controller.",
        "To provide scalable, high-bandwidth, and low-latency communication between a large number of intellectual property (IP) blocks."
