      "question": "In multi-processor systems employing shared memory, which of the following statements best describes the guarantee provided by 'Sequential Consistency' as a memory consistency model?",
      "options": [
        "All memory operations from a single processor appear to execute in program order, but the interleaving of operations from different processors is arbitrary.",
        "All memory operations appear to execute in some global total order, and operations from each individual processor appear in program order within that total order, as if all operations were executed by a single processor in some interleaved sequence.",
        "Write operations from one processor are immediately visible to all other processors, but read operations can be reordered for performance.",
        "Writes from a processor are only visible to other processors after an explicit synchronization barrier is reached.",
        "Only strongly ordered memory operations (e.g., atomic operations) are guaranteed to be seen in program order by all processors."

      "question": "What is the fundamental difference in the design philosophy of a Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) versus a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture?",
      "options": [
        "CISC processors always have a greater number of general-purpose registers compared to RISC processors.",
        "RISC architectures prioritize simple, fixed-length instructions that can often execute in a single clock cycle, while CISC often uses complex, variable-length instructions that may take multiple cycles.",
        "CISC processors inherently lack cache memory, whereas RISC processors heavily rely on multi-level cache hierarchies.",
        "RISC instructions are always microcoded, while CISC instructions are always hardwired for speed.",
        "CISC processors primarily support register-to-register operations, while RISC processors support direct memory-to-memory operations."
