        "Multiple instructions attempting to access the same hardware resource simultaneously.",
        "A conditional branch instruction causing the pipeline to fetch instructions from an incorrect path.",

      "question": "Which technique is primarily used in advanced System-on-Chip (SoC) power management to completely cut off power to inactive functional blocks, thereby eliminating both static and dynamic power consumption in those regions?",

      "question": "What is the fundamental difference in purpose and application between an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)?",
      "options": [
        "ASICs are programmed after manufacturing using a bitstream, while FPGAs require a full custom mask set for fabrication.",
        "ASICs are optimized for high-performance and low-power in mass production, while FPGAs offer design flexibility and faster time-to-market for prototyping and lower volumes.",
        "ASICs contain only combinational logic gates, whereas FPGAs exclusively use sequential logic elements like flip-flops.",
        "FPGAs are purely analog circuits, while ASICs are exclusively used for digital processing.",
        "ASICs are typically used for general-purpose computing, while FPGAs are restricted to embedded control applications."
