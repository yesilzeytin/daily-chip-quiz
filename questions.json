      "question": "In the physical design flow of a digital integrated circuit, what is the primary objective of the 'Clock Tree Synthesis' (CTS) stage?",
      "options": [
        "To place standard cells and macros onto the chip area.",
        "To ensure all clock signals arrive at sequential elements at approximately the same time, minimizing skew.",
        "To determine the optimal routing paths for all data signals.",
        "To verify that the layout meets manufacturing design rules.",

      "question": "In the context of CPU caches, what is the primary characteristic of a 'Write-Back' cache policy compared to a 'Write-Through' policy?",
      "options": [
        "Write-Back updates main memory immediately upon a write hit, Write-Through does not.",
        "Write-Back always allocates a cache line on a write miss, Write-Through never does.",
        "Write-Back allows modified data to reside only in the cache for a period, deferring writes to main memory; Write-Through updates main memory concurrently.",
        "Write-Back maintains a snooping protocol, Write-Through does not.",
        "Write-Back is typically slower for write operations but consumes less power."
