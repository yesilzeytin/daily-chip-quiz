      "question": "Which of the following best describes the relationship between a processor's Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and its Microarchitecture?",
      "options": [
        "The ISA defines the high-level programming language used, while microarchitecture defines its compilation into machine code.",
        "The ISA specifies the functional behavior visible to a programmer, and the microarchitecture is a specific implementation of that ISA.",
        "Microarchitecture determines the physical dimensions and power consumption of the chip, while the ISA defines its clock frequency.",
        "The ISA dictates the type of operating system that can run on the processor, and microarchitecture optimizes memory access patterns.",

        "To ensure that the physical layout conforms to manufacturing process limitations and constraints.",
        "To analyze and optimize the timing performance of the circuit for speed.",
