      "options": [
        "Standard cell designs are programmed in the field by the user, while full custom designs are mask-programmed during manufacturing.",
        "Standard cell designs use pre-designed, characterized logic cells from a library, allowing for automated placement and routing, whereas full custom designs involve manual layout of every transistor.",
        "Full custom designs always consume less power than standard cell designs due to superior optimization capabilities.",
        "Standard cell designs are typically used for analog circuits, whereas full custom designs are exclusively for digital.",
