      "options": [
        "All processors have equal access latency to all parts of main memory, simplifying memory management.",
        "All memory is local to a specific processor, requiring explicit message passing for any data sharing between processors.",
        "Processors can access local memory faster than memory attached to other processors, making software optimization for data locality crucial for performance.",
