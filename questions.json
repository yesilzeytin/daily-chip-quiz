        "It is designed for a specific purpose or application, offering high performance and efficiency for that task.",
        "It can be reprogrammed multiple times by the user for different functionalities.",
        "It consists solely of analog components and does not process digital signals.",
        "It is primarily used as the main central processing unit (CPU) in general-purpose computers.",
        "It stores data permanently and is used exclusively for non-volatile memory applications."

      "question": "What is the primary impact of 'Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI)' on PMOS transistors in modern semiconductor devices?",
      "options": [
        "It causes an increase in the threshold voltage (Vt) of PMOS transistors over time, leading to performance degradation.",
        "It results in a decrease in the threshold voltage (Vt) of NMOS transistors, increasing leakage current.",
        "It causes the breakdown of gate oxide layers due to high electric fields at elevated temperatures.",
        "It leads to the physical displacement of metal atoms in interconnects, creating open circuits.",
        "It primarily affects the integrity of non-volatile memory cells, causing data corruption."

      "question": "In a System-on-Chip (SoC) design, what is the primary advantage of using a Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture compared to a traditional bus-based interconnect for complex multi-core systems?",
      "options": [
        "It simplifies the routing of signals, reducing design complexity and area.",
        "It provides higher scalability and parallel communication bandwidth, enabling better performance for many communicating IP blocks.",
        "It inherently guarantees cache coherence across all connected processing units without additional hardware.",
        "It consumes significantly less static power due to its simpler arbitration mechanisms.",
        "It eliminates the need for any clock synchronization mechanisms across different IP blocks."
