      "question": "In cache memory design, what is the primary purpose of a 'dirty bit' associated with a cache line?",
      "options": [
        "To indicate if the cache line has been accessed recently by the CPU.",
        "To mark the cache line as invalid and ready for replacement.",
        "To show that the data in the cache line is inconsistent with other caches.",
        "To signify that the data in the cache line has been modified and is different from main memory.",
        "To prioritize which cache line to evict first during a cache miss."

    {
      "question": "In the physical design verification phase of an integrated circuit, what is the primary purpose of Design Rule Checking (DRC)?",
      "options": [
        "To ensure that the layout matches the schematic (logical netlist).",
        "To verify the timing performance of the circuit against specifications.",
        "To check if the physical layout adheres to manufacturing constraints and geometric rules.",
        "To analyze the power consumption and integrity of the power delivery network.",
        "To optimize the placement of standard cells for minimal wire length."

      "question": "In modern out-of-order execution processors, what is the primary goal of employing 'speculative execution'?",
      "options": [
        "To reduce the overall power consumption of the CPU.",
        "To allow multiple threads to execute concurrently on a single core.",
        "To hide memory latency by prefetching data from main memory.",
        "To improve performance by executing instructions before it is certain they are needed, particularly to mitigate control hazards.",
        "To ensure strict program order for all instructions, preventing data dependencies."

    {
      "question": "For advanced technology nodes (e.g., 3nm and beyond), Gate-All-Around (GAA) FETs are often preferred over FinFETs. What is the primary advantage of GAAFETs in this context?",
      "options": [
        "Reduced manufacturing cost due to simpler fabrication steps.",
        "Significantly lower leakage current due to shorter channel lengths.",
        "Enhanced electrostatic control of the channel, leading to better short-channel effects and scalability.",
        "Higher drive current at the same supply voltage due to increased gate capacitance.",
        "Improved immunity to soft errors caused by cosmic rays."
