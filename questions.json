        "To increase the driving strength or fan-out capability of a signal without inverting its logic state.",
        "To invert the logic state of a signal (e.g., 0 to 1, or 1 to 0).",
        "To store a single bit of information for a specific duration.",
        "To select one of multiple input signals and route it to a single output.",

      "question": "Which timing parameter describes the minimum amount of time a synchronous data input must be stable *before* the active clock edge for a flip-flop to reliably capture the data?",

      "question": "In the context of modern pipelined processors, what is the primary purpose of a 'branch predictor'?",
      "options": [
        "To resolve data dependencies between instructions and prevent read-after-write hazards.",
        "To predict the outcome of conditional branch instructions and the target address, allowing the pipeline to fetch instructions speculatively.",
        "To manage and allocate functional units to instructions for out-of-order execution.",
        "To ensure that all instructions are committed in program order, even if executed out-of-order.",
        "To translate virtual memory addresses into physical memory addresses efficiently."

      "question": "As a low-power design technique, why is reducing the supply voltage (VDD) particularly effective in reducing dynamic power consumption in CMOS digital circuits?",
      "options": [
        "Dynamic power is directly proportional to the switching frequency, so reducing VDD automatically reduces frequency.",
        "Dynamic power is linearly proportional to VDD, so a small reduction in voltage yields a proportional power saving.",
        "Dynamic power is quadratically proportional to VDD (P_dynamic = C * VDD^2 * f), making voltage reduction highly impactful.",
        "Reducing VDD primarily reduces static leakage current, which is the dominant power component.",
        "It increases the transistor threshold voltage, thus slowing down switching and saving power."

        "To selectively remove material using chemical etchants to define patterns.",
        "To deposit thin layers of conductive or insulating materials onto the wafer surface.",
        "To create a very flat and smooth surface on the wafer by simultaneously using chemical slurry and mechanical polishing, crucial for multi-layer interconnects.",
        "To introduce dopant atoms into the silicon to form N-type and P-type regions.",
        "To form the electrical connections between different layers of the integrated circuit."
