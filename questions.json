      "question": "In the physical verification phase of an integrated circuit design, what is the main purpose of *Design Rule Checking (DRC)*?",
      "options": [
        "To verify that all logical gates are connected correctly according to the netlist.",
        "To ensure the design adheres to the manufacturing capabilities and limitations of the foundry.",
        "To simulate the circuit's behavior under various operating conditions.",

      "question": "In multi-processor systems, which statement best describes a *weak consistency model* for memory?",
      "options": [
        "All memory operations appear to execute in the program order of each processor, and all processors observe memory operations in the same global total order.",
        "Writes from one processor are immediately visible to all other processors.",
        "It allows for reordering of memory operations, but provides mechanisms (e.g., fences or barriers) to enforce ordering when explicitly required by the programmer.",
        "Cache coherence is maintained exclusively through snooping protocols on a shared bus.",
        "It prioritizes strict global ordering of all memory accesses over performance."

      "question": "In Static Timing Analysis (STA), what does a *positive slack* value on a timing path indicate?",
      "options": [
        "The path is a critical path and will cause a timing violation.",
        "The signal arrives at the destination flip-flop's data input too late for the setup time.",
        "The signal arrives at the destination flip-flop's data input with margin, meeting its timing requirements.",
        "The path will incur excessive dynamic power consumption.",
        "The clock signal is skewed significantly, potentially causing hold time violations."
