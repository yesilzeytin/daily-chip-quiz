        "To create the initial logical layout of the major functional blocks on the silicon die.",
        "To optimize the timing of the logic gates to meet setup and hold requirements by adjusting gate sizes.",

        "To maintain a record of which caches hold a copy of each memory block and its current state (e.g., shared, modified, invalid).",
        "To buffer write operations to main memory, allowing them to be completed asynchronously.",
        "To provide fast lookup for branch target addresses to improve pipeline performance.",

      "question": "In digital circuit design, what is the primary reason for performing `glitch analysis`?",
      "options": [
        "To measure the overall static power consumption of the circuit.",
        "To identify unintended momentary changes (glitches) at the outputs of combinational logic that could cause false triggering in sequential elements.",
        "To verify the correctness of complex arithmetic operations in the data path.",
        "To ensure the physical layout meets all manufacturing design rules (e.g., minimum spacing, width).",
