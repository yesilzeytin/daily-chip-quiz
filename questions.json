      "question": "In semiconductor chip interconnects, what is 'Electromigration' primarily and why is it a significant reliability concern at advanced technology nodes?",
      "options": [
        "It is the unwanted transfer of electrons between adjacent metal layers due to capacitive coupling, causing crosstalk noise.",
        "It is the physical displacement of metal atoms in an interconnect line caused by momentum transfer from flowing electrons, leading to opens or shorts over time.",
        "It refers to the effect where high electric fields across the gate oxide lead to electron tunneling, increasing leakage current.",
        "It is the degradation of transistor performance due to the trapping of hot carriers in the gate dielectric, shifting threshold voltage.",
        "It is the parasitic resistance and capacitance formed by the interconnects, which delays signal propagation and increases power consumption."
