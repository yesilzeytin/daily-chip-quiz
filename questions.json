      "question": "In digital IC design, what is the primary purpose of incorporating 'scan chains' into a circuit?",

      "question": "In computer architecture, what is the primary distinguishing characteristic of a Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) processor compared to a superscalar processor?",
      "options": [
        "VLIW processors use a deep pipeline to increase instruction throughput.",
        "VLIW processors rely on hardware-based dynamic scheduling to find instruction-level parallelism at runtime.",
        "VLIW processors execute multiple operations in parallel based on explicit scheduling by the compiler.",

      "question": "As transistor dimensions continue to shrink into the nanometer regime (e.g., below 7nm), which fundamental quantum mechanical phenomenon increasingly contributes to leakage current and poses a significant challenge for circuit reliability and power consumption?",
      "options": [
        "Doppler effect.",
        "Photoelectric effect.",
        "Quantum tunneling.",

      "question": "In computer architecture, what is the primary distinction of 'memory-mapped I/O' compared to 'port-mapped I/O' (or isolated I/O)?",
      "options": [
        "Memory-mapped I/O uses a dedicated set of instructions for I/O operations, separate from memory access instructions.",
        "Memory-mapped I/O devices share the same address space as main memory, allowing them to be accessed using standard memory load/store instructions.",
        "Memory-mapped I/O requires a separate I/O bus, distinct from the system memory bus.",
        "Memory-mapped I/O prevents direct memory access (DMA) by peripheral devices.",
        "Memory-mapped I/O is exclusively used in Harvard architectures, while port-mapped I/O is used in Von Neumann architectures."
