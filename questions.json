      "question": "What is the primary purpose of \"floorplanning\" in the physical design stage of an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or custom IC?",
      "options": [
        "To define the coarse placement of major functional blocks and I/O pads on the chip, estimating area and optimizing for interconnect and power distribution.",
        "To verify that the gate-level netlist is functionally equivalent to the Register Transfer Level (RTL) description.",
        "To perform detailed routing of all signal and power connections between standard cells.",
        "To ensure that all design rules (e.g., minimum width, spacing) are met for manufacturability.",
        "To generate a test pattern suite for post-silicon validation and debug."

      "question": "In cache memory systems, what is the primary advantage of a \"set-associative\" cache over a \"direct-mapped\" cache of the same total size?",
      "options": [
        "It significantly reduces conflict misses by allowing multiple cache blocks to map to the same set.",
        "It provides faster access times (lower hit latency) due to simpler tag comparison logic.",
        "It guarantees that all data access requests will result in a cache hit.",
        "It consumes less power because fewer memory accesses are required.",
        "It simplifies the hardware design by eliminating the need for a replacement policy."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the phenomenon known as \"clock skew\" in synchronous digital circuits?",
      "options": [
        "The difference in arrival times of the same active clock edge at different synchronous elements (e.g., flip-flops) across the chip.",
        "The variation in the clock signal's period over successive cycles, often referred to as cycle-to-cycle jitter.",
        "The total delay experienced by a clock signal as it propagates from its source to a specific register's clock input.",
        "The unwanted capacitive or inductive coupling of a clock signal into an adjacent data or control signal line.",
        "The phase difference between the input and output clock signals of a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)."

      "question": "In a modern out-of-order superscalar processor, which of the following best describes the primary function of the \"Instruction Window\" (also known as the Reservation Station)?",
      "options": [
        "It temporarily stores instructions that have completed execution but are waiting to commit their results in program order.",
        "It holds decoded instructions, waiting for their operands to become available and for a functional unit to be free before dispatching them for execution.",
        "It serves as a cache for recent virtual-to-physical address translations to accelerate memory access.",
        "It manages the allocation and deallocation of physical registers to facilitate register renaming.",
        "It predicts the outcome of conditional branch instructions to avoid pipeline stalls."

      "question": "Which advanced transistor technology is primarily characterized by a 3D gate structure that wraps around the channel on multiple sides, significantly improving electrostatic control and reducing leakage currents compared to planar transistors at smaller process nodes?",

        "Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT)",
        "Fin Field-Effect Transistor (FinFET)",
