      "question": "What is the primary characteristic that differentiates Static RAM (SRAM) from Dynamic RAM (DRAM) cells?",
      "options": [
        "SRAM uses capacitors that require periodic refreshing, while DRAM does not.",
        "DRAM is volatile (loses data when power is removed), while SRAM is non-volatile.",
        "SRAM cells are typically larger and consume more static power per bit than DRAM cells.",
        "DRAM offers significantly faster access times compared to SRAM.",
        "SRAM requires continuous refreshing to retain data, whereas DRAM does not."

    {
      "question": "In digital IC design, what is the primary purpose of 'power gating'?",
      "options": [
        "To provide a regulated voltage supply to different circuit blocks.",
        "To allow for dynamic clock frequency scaling across the chip.",
        "To eliminate static (leakage) power consumption in inactive circuit blocks.",
        "To reduce dynamic power consumption during active operation.",

      "question": "What is the primary motivation for using a Network-on-Chip (NoC) instead of a traditional shared bus architecture for communication in complex System-on-Chip (SoC) designs?",
      "options": [
        "Lower design complexity for small systems with few IP blocks.",
        "Guaranteed lower latency for all transactions regardless of traffic.",
        "Simpler verification due to inherent synchronous operation across all nodes.",
        "Superior scalability, higher bandwidth, and better isolation for an increasing number of IP blocks.",
        "Reduced overall power consumption irrespective of communication patterns."

    {
      "question": "In static timing analysis (STA), what is the primary purpose of 'derating' factors?",
      "options": [
        "To reduce the overall number of timing paths that need to be analyzed.",
        "To account for the impact of process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations on cell and interconnect delays.",
        "To simplify the clock tree synthesis process by abstracting complex delays.",
        "To improve the accuracy of gate-level simulation by modeling signal integrity effects.",
        "To verify the functional correctness of the design under various corner cases."
