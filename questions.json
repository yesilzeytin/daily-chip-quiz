      "options": [
        "To perform physical layout verification checks.",
        "To define the instruction set for a custom processor.",

      "question": "In synchronous digital design, what does the 'setup time' of a flip-flop primarily refer to?",
      "options": [
        "The minimum time the input data must be held stable *after* the active clock edge.",
        "The maximum time it takes for the clock signal to propagate from its source to the flip-flop.",
        "The minimum time the input data must be stable *before* the active clock edge to be reliably captured.",
        "The maximum delay through the combinational logic feeding the flip-flop.",

      "question": "In a multi-processor system with private caches, what is the primary role of a 'cache coherence protocol'?",
      "options": [
        "To determine which block of data to evict when the cache is full.",
        "To translate virtual addresses to physical addresses for cache access.",
        "To ensure that all processors have a consistent view of shared memory, even when data is replicated in multiple caches.",
        "To manage the flow of instructions through a pipeline.",
        "To optimize the power consumption of the cache memory."

        "Re-programmability after manufacturing.",
        "Faster time-to-market for initial prototyping.",
        "Lower Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs.",
