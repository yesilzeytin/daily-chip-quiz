      "question": "What is the primary purpose of a \"photomask\" (or reticle) in semiconductor manufacturing?",
      "options": [
        "To filter impurities from the silicon wafer before processing.",
        "To selectively block or transmit UV light patterns onto a photoresist-coated wafer during lithography.",
        "To store the design layout data for the entire chip in a digital format.",
        "To apply the metal interconnect layers on the chip through a deposition process.",
        "To cool the wafer rapidly during the etching process to prevent damage."

    {
      "question": "What does \"clock skew\" primarily refer to in synchronous digital circuits, and why is it a significant concern?",
      "options": [
        "It is the intentional variation in the frequency of the clock signal to reduce power consumption.",
        "It is the difference in arrival times of a single clock edge at different sequential elements (e.g., flip-flops) across the chip, which can lead to setup or hold time violations.",
        "It describes the degradation of the clock signal's waveform due to noise, potentially causing false triggering of logic gates.",
        "It refers to the maximum tolerable clock frequency for a given design before it becomes unstable.",
        "It is the measure of how much the clock signal is delayed by buffers in the clock distribution network, impacting overall performance."

      "question": "In a multi-processor system, which memory consistency model generally allows a processor to read its own previously written value immediately, but delays the visibility of writes from other processors until explicit synchronization points, offering a trade-off for improved performance?",
      "options": [
        "Sequential Consistency",
        "Strong Consistency",
        "Atomic Consistency",

      "question": "Beyond Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), which common low-power design technique involves selectively disabling the clock signal to inactive portions of a circuit or module to reduce dynamic power consumption?",
