      "question": "What is the primary advantage of a Harvard architecture over a Von Neumann architecture in terms of instruction and data access?",
      "options": [
        "It simplifies the overall memory management unit (MMU) design and implementation.",
        "It allows for simultaneous fetching of instructions and loading/storing of data due to separate memory spaces/buses, improving throughput.",
        "It inherently reduces the static power consumption of the processor.",
        "It enables direct support for shared-memory multiprocessing without additional hardware.",
        "It uses a single, unified cache hierarchy for both instructions and data, reducing complexity."

    {
      "question": "In advanced CMOS technology, what is the primary purpose of 'dummy fills' or 'filler cells' during the physical design backend flow?",
      "options": [
        "To provide additional power and ground connections for complex macros that require higher current.",
        "To act as placeholders for future design changes or for implementing built-in self-test (BIST) structures.",
        "To ensure sufficient metal density for manufacturing processes like Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) and prevent dishing or erosion.",
        "To serve as test points for on-chip debuggers and logic analyzers.",
        "To isolate sensitive analog components from digital noise on the same die."

    {
      "question": "In modern memory systems, what is the primary benefit of using Error-Correcting Code (ECC) memory?",
      "options": [
        "It significantly increases the overall memory bandwidth, allowing for faster data transfer rates.",
        "It enables memory modules to operate reliably at much lower voltages, reducing power consumption.",
        "It detects and corrects single-bit errors, and sometimes multi-bit errors, enhancing data integrity and system reliability.",
        "It provides faster access times to stored data compared to non-ECC memory modules.",
        "It encrypts all data stored in main memory, improving security against unauthorized access."
