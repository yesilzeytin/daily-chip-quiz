      "question": "What is a key architectural characteristic that primarily distinguishes Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) from Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC)?",
      "options": [
        "RISC architectures typically feature a larger and more complex set of instructions.",
        "CISC architectures prioritize fixed-length instructions and a load/store architecture.",

      "question": "In a modern out-of-order superscalar processor, what is the main purpose of 'register renaming'?",
      "options": [
        "To reduce the number of physical registers required in the processor.",
        "To allow multiple instructions to concurrently use the same architectural register without false dependencies (WAR/WAW hazards).",
        "To simplify the instruction decoding stage by providing unique names for each instruction's operands.",
        "To store the results of speculative execution until they are committed.",
