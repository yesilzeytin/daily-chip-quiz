      "options": [
        "RISC architectures primarily use out-of-order execution, while CISC architectures always use in-order execution.",
        "RISC architectures generally favor a smaller, simpler set of instructions that execute quickly, often in a single cycle, while CISC architectures allow for a larger, more complex set of instructions that may take multiple cycles.",
        "CISC architectures always feature a Harvard memory architecture, whereas RISC architectures always use Von Neumann.",
