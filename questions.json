      "question": "What is the primary characteristic of an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) that distinguishes it from an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit)?",
      "options": [
        "FPGAs are designed to be re-programmed by the end-user or designer after manufacturing.",
        "FPGAs offer significantly lower power consumption and higher clock frequencies compared to ASICs for high-volume production.",
        "FPGAs typically require custom mask sets and a lengthy fabrication process for their realization.",

      "options": [
        "High electric fields causing hot electrons to inject into the gate oxide from the channel.",
        "The formation of interface traps at the silicon-dielectric interface under negative gate bias and elevated temperature, typically due to hydrogen bond breaking.",
