      "question": "What is the primary purpose of a 'testbench' in the digital IC design verification flow?",
      "options": [
        "To verify the functional correctness and behavior of the designed hardware against its specifications.",
        "To convert the high-level design description (RTL) into a gate-level netlist.",
        "To perform the physical placement of standard cells and routing of interconnects.",

      "question": "In the context of computer architecture, what does the 'locality of reference' principle describe, and why is it fundamental to the effectiveness of cache memory?",
      "options": [
        "It describes the tendency of memory references to cluster in time (temporal locality) and space (spatial locality), allowing caches to predict future accesses and store relevant data nearby.",
        "It refers to the physical proximity of different memory types (e.g., DRAM, SRAM) on the same circuit board to minimize access latency.",
        "It's a security principle ensuring that data from different processes remains isolated in distinct memory regions.",
        "It dictates that data should always be stored in the closest possible memory module to the CPU to minimize propagation delay.",
        "It's a technique used by the operating system to allocate contiguous blocks of virtual memory to processes."

      "question": "What is the primary role of a 'Design for Testability (DFT)' methodology in modern digital IC design?",
      "options": [
        "To optimize the power consumption of the chip during its operation.",
        "To ensure the final chip can be thoroughly and cost-effectively tested for manufacturing defects after fabrication.",
        "To define the instruction set architecture (ISA) for the processor core.",

      "question": "In the physical design phase of an integrated circuit, what is 'Design Rule Checking (DRC)' primarily used for, beyond basic geometric validation?",
      "options": [
        "To ensure that the timing requirements are met across all clock domains of the design.",
        "To verify that the layout adheres to the foundry's manufacturing process rules, preventing fabrication errors and ensuring yield.",
        "To simulate the functional behavior of the chip with parasitic extracted from the layout.",
        "To identify and correct electromigration issues in high-current traces.",

      "question": "In an advanced out-of-order superscalar processor implementing Tomasulo's algorithm, what is the primary function of a 'Reservation Station'?",
      "options": [
        "To store decoded instructions before they are dispatched to the reorder buffer.",
        "To hold executed instructions' results until they can be written back to the register file in program order.",
        "To buffer operands and instructions for a functional unit, allowing instructions to execute as soon as their operands are ready, independent of their original program order.",
        "To manage and predict the outcomes of conditional branches to reduce pipeline stalls.",
        "To ensure cache coherence among multiple processor cores in a shared memory system."
