      "question": "In a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architecture, what is the primary characteristic that distinguishes memory access times?",
      "options": [
        "All processors have uniform access times to all memory locations, irrespective of physical proximity.",
        "Accessing memory physically located on a processor's own node (local memory) is significantly faster than accessing memory on another node (remote memory).",
        "Memory access times are solely determined by the cache hit rate, making all main memory accesses appear uniform.",
        "Memory is organized as a single global address space, but only one processor can access it at any given time.",
        "The architecture relies entirely on shared L1/L2 caches, eliminating the need for main memory access differentiation."
