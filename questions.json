        "It increases the power consumption of static logic gates uncontrollably.",
        "It refers to parasitic capacitance effects that cause unpredictable signal reflections on long traces.",
        "It introduces variations in gate delays and wire resistances across the chip, making accurate timing prediction and worst-case analysis significantly more complex.",
