      "question": "What is the primary advantage of FinFET (Fin Field-Effect Transistor) devices over traditional planar MOSFETs in modern deep submicron technology nodes?",
      "options": [
        "Reduced short-channel effects and improved electrostatic control of the channel.",
        "Significantly lower manufacturing cost due to simpler fabrication processes.",
        "Elimination of the need for a gate dielectric material.",
        "Increased parasitic capacitance, leading to faster switching speeds.",
        "Higher leakage current in the 'off' state, allowing for dynamic power savings."

      "question": "In the context of digital Integrated Circuit (IC) design, what is the main purpose of inserting 'scan chains' during the Design for Testability (DFT) phase?",
      "options": [
        "To reduce the overall power consumption of the circuit during normal functional operation.",
        "To allow for the easy observation and control of internal register states, simplifying fault detection and diagnosis.",
        "To improve the circuit's performance by shortening the critical path delay.",
        "To facilitate the implementation of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) techniques.",
        "To encrypt sensitive design data and prevent intellectual property theft."

    {
      "question": "In a multi-processor system with private caches, what is the fundamental characteristic that distinguishes a 'snooping' cache coherence protocol from a 'directory-based' protocol?",
      "options": [
        "Snooping protocols use a central, shared memory controller to arbitrate all cache line requests, while directory protocols decentralize this control.",
        "Directory protocols are typically used in smaller-scale systems due to their high bus bandwidth requirements, whereas snooping scales better for very large core counts.",
        "Snooping protocols rely on broadcasting cache-related transactions over a shared bus that all caches observe, while directory protocols maintain a distributed record of which caches hold copies of each memory block.",
        "Snooping protocols are inherently simpler to implement but suffer from significantly higher latency for cache misses compared to directory protocols.",
        "Directory protocols exclusively utilize a write-through cache policy, whereas snooping protocols always use write-back."

      "question": "Which formal verification technique specifically focuses on mathematically proving that two different representations of a digital circuit (e.g., a Register-Transfer Level (RTL) description and a synthesized gate-level netlist) are functionally equivalent?",
      "options": [
        "Constrained Random Simulation (CRS)",
        "Equivalence Checking (EC)",
        "Assertion-Based Verification (ABV)",

    {
      "question": "What is the primary advantage of using a floating-point number representation (like the IEEE 754 standard) over a fixed-point representation in computer architecture?",
      "options": [
        "It always results in faster arithmetic operations for all types of calculations.",
        "It simplifies the hardware implementation of basic arithmetic units significantly.",
        "It provides a much wider dynamic range and greater precision for representing very small or very large numbers.",
        "It requires less memory storage space for a given number of bits compared to fixed-point.",
        "It completely eliminates all forms of rounding and truncation errors in computations."
