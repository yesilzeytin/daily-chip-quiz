      "question": "What is the primary characteristic that distinguishes a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) from an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)?",
      "options": [
        "FPGAs consume significantly less power than ASICs for any given task.",
        "FPGAs are designed for mass production, while ASICs are exclusively used for prototyping.",
        "FPGAs can be reconfigured or reprogrammed after manufacturing to implement different digital circuits.",
        "ASICs always offer higher clock speeds and lower latency compared to FPGAs for any application.",
        "FPGAs primarily consist of analog components, while ASICs are purely digital."

      "question": "In computer architecture, what does the term \"microarchitecture\" primarily refer to?",
      "options": [
        "The instruction set architecture (ISA) that defines the programmer's view of the processor.",
        "The physical layout and fabrication process of the integrated circuit on a silicon wafer.",
        "The specific implementation details of a processor that realize a given instruction set architecture.",
        "The operating system's interface for managing CPU resources and processes.",

    {
      "question": "In the physical design phase of an integrated circuit, what is the primary purpose of Design Rule Checking (DRC)?",
      "options": [
        "To verify the functional correctness of the circuit against its Register Transfer Level (RTL) description.",
        "To simulate the circuit's timing performance under various operating conditions and temperatures.",
        "To ensure that the physical layout of the circuit adheres to the manufacturing process limitations and geometric rules, preventing fabrication errors.",
        "To optimize the placement of standard logic cells and macro blocks for minimal area and power consumption.",
        "To generate the test patterns and vectors required for post-manufacturing testing of the chip."

    {
      "question": "In advanced out-of-order execution processors, what is the primary purpose of \"Register Renaming\"?",
      "options": [
        "To translate virtual memory addresses to physical memory addresses for efficient memory access.",
        "To resolve true Read-After-Write (RAW) data hazards by forwarding results directly between functional units.",
        "To convert logical (architectural) register numbers specified in instructions into unique physical register numbers, thereby eliminating Write-After-Write (WAW) and Write-After-Read (WAR) hazards.",
        "To allow the operating system to dynamically allocate and deallocate physical register sets to different processes.",
        "To reduce the overall number of physical registers required in the processor by reusing them more efficiently."

      "question": "What is the defining characteristic of a \"sequential logic circuit\" that distinguishes it from a \"combinational logic circuit\"?",
      "options": [
        "Sequential circuits are always faster and consume less power than combinational circuits.",
        "Sequential circuits use only basic logic gates like AND, OR, and NOT, while combinational circuits use more complex gates.",
        "The output of a sequential circuit depends solely on its current inputs, whereas a combinational circuit's output depends on past inputs and internal state.",
        "Sequential circuits incorporate memory elements (e.g., flip-flops or latches) to store past states, making their output dependent on both current inputs and previous inputs (or state).",
        "Combinational circuits strictly require a clock signal for operation, while sequential circuits operate entirely asynchronously."
