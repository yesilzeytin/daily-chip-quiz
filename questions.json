      "question": "What is the key advantage of using a 'Register Renaming' technique in modern out-of-order execution processors?",
      "options": [

        "It eliminates true data dependencies (Read-After-Write hazards) between instructions, enabling more parallelism.",
        "It allows instructions to execute out-of-order by resolving Write-After-Read (WAR) and Write-After-Write (WAW) hazards, which are false data dependencies.",
        "It primarily speeds up memory access by assigning unique identifiers to frequently used cache lines.",
        "It simplifies the instruction fetch and decode stages of the pipeline by using smaller register identifiers."
