      "question": "In the context of CPU caches, what is the primary advantage of a 'set-associative' cache over a 'direct-mapped' cache?",
      "options": [
        "It inherently offers faster access times for a cache hit.",
        "It requires significantly less hardware complexity and smaller area.",
        "It provides a better hit rate by reducing the frequency of conflict misses.",
        "It completely eliminates the need for a cache coherence protocol in multi-core systems.",
        "It simplifies the replacement policy, making it easier to implement."
