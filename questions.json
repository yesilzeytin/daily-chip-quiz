        "To store instructions that are currently waiting for their operands to become available.",
        "To pre-fetch data from memory into the cache before it is explicitly requested by an instruction.",
        "To ensure that instructions complete and commit their results in program order, even if they executed out of order, and to handle precise exceptions.",

        "Simpler verification due to the absence of timing closure issues.",
        "Immunity to power supply variations, making circuits more robust.",
        "Elimination of global clock distribution networks, leading to reduced power consumption and potentially higher operating speeds without clock skew constraints.",
