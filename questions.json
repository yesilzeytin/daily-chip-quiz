      "options": [
        "It can represent an infinite range of values.",
        "It is always a perfect sine wave.",
        "It represents information using a discrete set of values (e.g., high/low, 0/1).",
        "It is only susceptible to noise at very low frequencies.",
        "It requires significantly less power to transmit."

      "question": "In computer architecture, what is the primary purpose of an 'interrupt' mechanism?",
      "options": [
        "To improve the efficiency of prefetching data into cache memory.",
        "To allow the CPU to respond to external events or asynchronous requests from peripherals or software.",
        "To synchronize the execution of multiple instructions within a pipeline.",
        "To manage the translation of virtual addresses to physical addresses.",

      "question": "In digital IC verification, what is the main objective of achieving 'functional coverage'?",
      "options": [
        "To measure the power consumption of the design under various operating conditions.",
        "To ensure that all lines of RTL code have been simulated at least once.",
        "To confirm that all specified design features, behaviors, and corner cases have been exercised and observed during simulation.",
        "To verify the physical layout rules and geometric correctness of the design.",
        "To analyze the timing performance of critical paths across different process corners."

      "question": "In the physical design flow of a digital integrated circuit, what is the primary reason for inserting buffers into a signal net?",
      "options": [
        "To reduce the overall transistor count for power efficiency.",
        "To increase the logic complexity of the Boolean function implemented by the net.",
        "To improve signal integrity by strengthening the signal drive, reducing transition times (slew), and mitigating propagation delay issues.",
        "To provide a direct connection to the power supply for the gate.",
        "To store data temporarily for pipelined operations."

      "question": "In a pipelined processor, what is a 'data hazard' primarily caused by?",
      "options": [
        "The uncertainty in determining the target address of a branch instruction.",
        "A dependency where a subsequent instruction attempts to read a register before a preceding instruction has finished writing to it.",
        "Multiple instructions trying to access the same functional unit simultaneously.",
        "The inability to fetch new instructions from memory fast enough to keep the pipeline full.",
        "A conflict in accessing the main memory due to a cache miss."
