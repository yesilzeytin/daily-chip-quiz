        "The output depends solely on the current inputs.",
        "They always require a clock signal for their operation.",
        "They have the ability to store memory or state.",

      "question": "In the physical design phase of an integrated circuit, what is the primary purpose of Design Rule Checking (DRC)?",
      "options": [
        "To verify the functional correctness of the synthesized netlist.",
        "To simulate the power consumption and thermal characteristics of the chip.",
        "To ensure the layout adheres to specific geometric and electrical manufacturing process constraints.",

      "question": "In a cache coherence protocol like MESI (Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid), what does the 'Modified' state of a cache line primarily indicate?",
      "options": [
        "The cache line is valid and clean, meaning its data matches main memory, and it is the only copy in any cache.",
        "The cache line is valid and clean, meaning its data matches main memory, and other caches may also have a clean copy.",
        "The cache line is currently being transferred between the cache and main memory.",
        "The cache line has been modified in this cache, is dirty (does not match main memory), and this cache holds the only valid copy.",
        "The cache line contains invalid data and must be reloaded from main memory or another cache."

        "The degradation of transistor gate oxides due to high electric fields over time.",
        "The unintended coupling of signals between adjacent interconnects, leading to noise.",
        "The physical displacement of metal atoms in interconnects due to sustained high current density, potentially causing opens or shorts.",

        "To perform arithmetic and logical operations on data.",
        "To store program instructions and data temporarily.",
        "To fetch the next instruction from memory.",
        "To interpret the fetched instruction and generate control signals for other CPU components.",
