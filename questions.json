      "question": "What is the primary purpose of a 'technology library' (also known as a standard cell library) in the context of digital IC design synthesis?",
      "options": [
        "To provide a set of pre-designed and characterized basic logic gates, flip-flops, and other cells specific to a foundry's manufacturing process.",
        "To define the high-level behavioral model of the entire System-on-Chip (SoC) for architectural exploration.",
        "To specify the power supply voltages and current requirements for the integrated circuit.",
        "To generate the physical layout routing paths between different functional blocks on the chip.",

      "options": [
        "Clock gating completely cuts off the power supply to inactive blocks, while power gating disables the clock signal to them.",
        "Clock gating reduces dynamic power by preventing unnecessary clock toggles, while power gating reduces static power by turning off power rails to inactive blocks.",
        "Clock gating is applied only to combinational logic, whereas power gating is applied only to sequential logic.",
        "Clock gating requires additional external control signals, while power gating is managed entirely by internal logic.",
        "Clock gating aims to improve performance, while power gating focuses on improving reliability."
