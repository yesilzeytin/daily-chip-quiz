      "options": [
        "It models sequential logic elements, such as flip-flops and latches.",
        "It ensures that assignments are evaluated and updated sequentially within the current time step, typically used for combinational logic.",
        "It delays the update of a signal until the end of the current simulation time step, crucial for preventing race conditions in sequential logic.",
        "It defines the clock signal frequency for synchronous operations.",
        "It is used exclusively for defining module inputs and outputs."
