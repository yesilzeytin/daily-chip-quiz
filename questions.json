      "question": "What is the primary function of a multiplexer (MUX) in digital logic circuits?",
      "options": [
        "To select one of several input signals and forward it to a single output line.",
        "To convert analog signals to digital signals.",
        "To store a single bit of data.",
        "To generate a clock signal for synchronous circuits.",
        "To perform arithmetic operations like addition or subtraction."

      "question": "In a multi-core processor system, what is the primary purpose of a 'write-back' cache policy, as opposed to a 'write-through' policy?",
      "options": [
        "To prioritize cache hits over cache misses.",
        "To reduce the frequency of writes to main memory, improving performance and reducing bus traffic.",
        "To ensure that data is immediately written to main memory upon modification.",
        "To prefetch data from main memory before it is requested.",
        "To prevent data from being written into the cache."

    {
      "question": "In Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) like Verilog, what is the primary characteristic and typical use of a 'non-blocking assignment' (e.g., using the `<=` operator) when modeling sequential digital logic?",
      "options": [
        "It is used exclusively for defining constants and parameters in a design.",
        "It prevents race conditions by blocking other assignments until the current one completes.",
        "It schedules the assignment to occur at the end of the current simulation time step, making it ideal for modeling flip-flops and registers.",
        "It evaluates and assigns values immediately within the current simulation time step, primarily used for combinational logic.",
        "It allows for the definition of high-level algorithmic behavior without specific hardware mapping."

      "question": "What phenomenon, often observed in n-MOSFETs, involves high-energy electrons or holes getting injected into the gate oxide, leading to threshold voltage shift and degradation of device performance over time?",

        "Electromigration",
        "Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI)",
