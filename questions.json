      "question": "In a pipelined processor, what is a 'control hazard' primarily caused by?",
      "options": [
        "An instruction attempting to read data before a previous instruction has written it.",
        "The next instruction to fetch depends on the outcome of a preceding branch or jump instruction.",
        "Two instructions requiring the same hardware resource at the same time.",

      "question": "What phenomenon primarily affects the performance of N-type MOSFETs over time due to the trapping of high-energy electrons (hot carriers) in the gate oxide, leading to a shift in threshold voltage and degradation of transconductance?",
      "options": [
        "Electromigration",
        "Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI)",
        "Time Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB)",

        "Each main memory block can be mapped to exactly one specific cache line determined by its address.",
        "Each main memory block can be mapped to any available cache line.",
        "Cache lines are divided into sets, and a main memory block can be mapped to any line within a specific set.",
        "The cache controller determines the mapping based on the least recently used algorithm.",

      "question": "Which memory consistency model provides the weakest guarantees, primarily allowing reads and writes by a processor to complete out of order with respect to other processors, and a processor's own writes to be seen by other processors out of order relative to its own reads, often used for performance optimization in distributed shared memory systems through explicit synchronization operations?",
      "options": [
        "Sequential Consistency",
        "Total Store Order (TSO)",
