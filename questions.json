      "question": "In pipelined processors with out-of-order execution, what is the primary purpose of a \"Reorder Buffer\" (ROB)?",
      "options": [
        "To store instructions that are waiting for their operands to become available for execution.",
        "To handle branch prediction failures and restore the correct architectural state of the processor.",
        "To ensure that instructions commit (write results to permanent architectural state) in their original program order, despite potentially executing out of order.",
        "To re-synchronize data transfers between different clock domains within the processor.",

      "options": [
        "The tendency for a processor to access memory locations that are either spatially (nearby addresses) or temporally (accessed recently) close to previously accessed locations.",
        "The ability of a processor to execute multiple independent instructions concurrently in a single clock cycle.",
        "The mechanism by which virtual memory addresses generated by the CPU are translated into physical memory addresses.",
        "The technique of predicting future memory accesses and pre-fetching data into the cache before it is explicitly requested by the CPU.",

      "question": "What is the fundamental difference between \"Static RAM (SRAM)\" and \"Dynamic RAM (DRAM)\" at a circuit level?",
      "options": [
        "SRAM uses a single transistor and a capacitor to store each bit, requiring periodic refresh, while DRAM uses a latch of multiple transistors and does not need refreshing.",
        "SRAM is typically used for main memory due to its high density, while DRAM is preferred for processor caches due to its speed.",
        "DRAM is non-volatile memory, meaning it retains its data even without power, unlike volatile SRAM.",
        "SRAM stores each bit using a latch (typically 4-6 transistors) and does not require periodic refreshing, whereas DRAM stores each bit using a capacitor and a transistor, which requires periodic refreshing to prevent charge leakage.",
        "DRAM offers significantly higher access speeds and lower power consumption compared to SRAM for the same capacity."
