      "question": "In a multi-processor system with private caches, what is the primary purpose of a cache coherence protocol?",
      "options": [
        "To reduce the latency of memory access by storing frequently used data closer to the CPU.",
        "To ensure that all processors observe a consistent view of memory, even when data is replicated in multiple caches.",
        "To translate virtual memory addresses into physical memory addresses.",
        "To manage the allocation and deallocation of memory pages in main memory.",
        "To prevent race conditions in multi-threaded software applications."

      "question": "When using a Hardware Description Language (HDL) like Verilog or VHDL, what is the fundamental difference in the outcome between simulating a design and synthesizing it for an ASIC or FPGA?",
      "options": [
        "Simulation validates the timing performance, while synthesis generates the physical layout.",
        "Simulation verifies the functional correctness and behavior, while synthesis transforms the HDL into a gate-level netlist.",
        "Simulation provides power consumption estimates, while synthesis optimizes the design for manufacturing yield.",
        "Simulation creates a graphical schematic of the circuit, while synthesis generates assembly code.",

      "question": "In computer architecture, when an interrupt occurs, what mechanism does the CPU typically use to determine which interrupt service routine (ISR) to execute?",
      "options": [
        "It polls all peripheral devices until the source of the interrupt is identified.",
        "It executes a default error handling routine that logs the event.",
        "It references an Interrupt Vector Table (IVT) using the interrupt number to find the ISR's starting address.",
        "It asks the operating system to dynamically load the appropriate ISR from disk.",
        "It restarts the processor and re-executes the last instruction."

    {
      "question": "In Static Timing Analysis (STA) of a digital circuit, what does a *negative slack* value on a critical path signify?",
      "options": [
        "The circuit is operating faster than its intended clock frequency.",
        "The design has met all its timing constraints with margin to spare.",
        "The actual data arrival time is earlier than the required data arrival time.",
        "The design fails to meet its timing requirements, meaning a timing violation exists.",
        "There is an excessive clock skew across the design."

      "question": "Which of the following statements best describes a key difference between a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)?",
      "options": [
        "FPGAs are designed to be manufactured in significantly larger volumes than ASICs.",
        "ASICs are reprogrammable after manufacturing, allowing for hardware updates in the field.",
        "FPGAs offer higher performance and lower power consumption compared to ASICs for the same function.",
        "ASICs are custom-designed for a specific function, resulting in better performance and efficiency, while FPGAs are reconfigurable generic hardware.",
        "FPGAs require a full mask set for manufacturing, leading to higher non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs."
