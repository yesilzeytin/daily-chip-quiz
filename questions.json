      "question": "In digital IC verification, what is the primary advantage of employing formal verification techniques (e.g., model checking, equivalence checking) compared to traditional simulation-based verification?",
      "options": [
        "It can execute the design much faster than simulation, significantly reducing verification cycles.",
        "It can mathematically prove the correctness of design properties for all possible input sequences and states, offering exhaustive verification.",
        "It requires significantly less computational power and memory resources than running extensive simulations for complex designs.",
        "It is more effective at identifying and debugging asynchronous issues and clock domain crossings.",
        "It provides accurate power consumption estimates for various operating scenarios without needing a testbench."

      "question": "What is the primary reason why Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) is typically used for a computer's main memory (RAM), while Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) is preferred for CPU caches?",
      "options": [
        "DRAM is significantly faster than SRAM, making it ideal for the CPU's direct access.",
        "SRAM is non-volatile, whereas DRAM loses its data when power is removed.",
        "DRAM cells are simpler and require fewer transistors than SRAM cells, enabling higher density and lower cost per bit.",
        "SRAM requires periodic refreshing of its stored charge, unlike DRAM.",
        "DRAM consumes substantially less power than SRAM, particularly in idle states."
